# Diamond-Price-Prediction

## About The Project

The Diamond Price Prediction project is an end-to-end machine learning initiative designed to forecast the prices of diamonds. Diamonds are highly valuable gemstones, and their prices can vary significantly based on various factors. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions of diamond prices, thereby offering valuable insights to both buyers and sellers in the diamond market.

## About the Data

The dataset The goal is to predict the price of a given diamond (Regression Analysis).

There are 10 independent variables (including id):

1. id: the unique identifier of each diamond
2. carat: Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
3. cut: Quality of Diamond Cut
4. color: Color of Diamond
5. clarity: Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
6. depth: The depth of the diamond is its height (in millimetres) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
7. table: A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
8. x : Diamond X dimension
9. y: Diamond Y dimension
10. z: Diamond Z dimension

Target variable:
price: Price of the given Diamond.
